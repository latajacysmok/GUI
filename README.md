# GUI
myFirstGui.py
The program contains a button that does something - it displays a number indicating how many times it was clicked by the user. 
In the technical sense, the procedure for handling button events deals with the updating of the 
click counter and changing the text displayed on the button.
mySecondGui.py
The Longevity program reveals the secret that ensures the usefulness of an aged age of 100 years, 
if the user enters a secret password (an extremely secure "okon" password). 
The user enters the password in the input field and then clicks the Accept button. 
If the password is correct, the program displays the key to longevity in the text field.
myThirdGui.py
The film selection program allows the user to select favorite movie genres from the list of three proposals: comedy, drama and romance.
Because the program uses check boxes, the user can choose as many (though very few) species as he likes.
The program displays the result of the user's choices in the text field.
